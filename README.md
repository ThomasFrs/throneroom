# ThroneRoom
ThroneRoom is a simple medieval game about resource management.\
I developed it when I started learning Python in April 2020 and have continuously seeked for improvement.

## How To Play
All commands either require numbers or the Enter key.\
Menus indicate which key to press to select specific commands.
